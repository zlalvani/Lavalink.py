        -------
        Multiple calls to this method within a short timeframe could cause issues with the player's
        internal state, which can cause errors when processing a :class:`TrackStartEvent`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        track: Union[:class:`AudioTrack`, :class:`DeferredAudioTrack`]
            The track to play.
        start_time: :class:`int`
            The number of milliseconds to offset the track by.
            If left unspecified or ``None`` is provided, the track will start from the beginning.
        end_time: :class:`int`
            The position at which the track should stop playing.
            This is an absolute position, so if you want the track to stop at 1 minute, you would pass 60000.
            The default behaviour is to play until no more data is received from the remote server.
            If left unspecified or ``None`` is provided, the default behaviour is exhibited.
        no_replace: :class:`bool`
            If set to true, operation will be ignored if a track is already playing or paused.
            The default behaviour is to always replace.
            If left unspecified or ``None`` is provided, the default behaviour is exhibited.
        volume: :class:`int`
            The initial volume to set. This is useful for changing the volume between tracks etc.
            If left unspecified or ``None`` is provided, the volume will remain at its current setting.
        pause: :class:`bool`
            Whether to immediately pause the track after loading it.
            The default behaviour is to never pause.
            If left unspecified or ``None`` is provided, the default behaviour is exhibited.
        **kwargs: Any
            The kwargs to use when playing. You can specify any extra parameters that may be
            used by plugins, which offer extra features not supported out-of-the-box by Lavalink.py.

        Returns
        -------
        Optional[:class:`RawPlayer`]
            The updated `player object`_, or ``None`` if a request wasn't made due to an empty payload.
